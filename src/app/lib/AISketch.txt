Facts:

AI Logic:

- If there are hint tokens and my partner needs information, give it
    - How do I know my partner has a move?
- If I have a card I can play safely, Play it
- If I have a card, I think I should play, Play it
    - What does that mean?
- If I had a card I can discard safely, discard it
